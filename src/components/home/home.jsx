// *****************************
// General Comments
// *****************************
// (1) Limiting Location Options: Instead of letting users pick any state
// we will reduce this to a managed system where
// iWealthRE's subject matter expertise is.

// (2) Buying Location Preference: We should let users pick
// their top three states.

// (3) Research Time: If I get money in July, I can't spend it at a
// live auction until August. This is because I need a minimum of
// 1 month to do research on properties. (make this a variable)

// (4) Lien cost on Secondary Market: Typical lien cost on the
// secondary market is 1 year tax plus some premium. This is the
// average redemptive value. Essentially, secondary buyers have to pay extra
// for not having to wait for the lien to mature. An important note here,
// when a person buys a lien on the seondary market timport Investor from './../../models/investor';

// will not be on the redemptive value, rather it will be on the original
// lien cost (which will be less than the redemptive cost).

// (5) Tool should assume live auction.
// -In which case we will show only the live auction lien vlaue
// -next to state option drop down
// -
// -If user toggles secondary
// -then we will only show them the secondary lien costs
